===========
REQUIREMENT
===========
librcsc-3.1.3 requires the following libraries:
 - boost-1.32 or later
 - (optional) cppunit-1.12.0 or later

Please install them first before you start the installation of
librcsc.

=======
INSTALL
=======
From the librcsc directory execute:

./configure
make
su
make install

This will built the neccesary libraries and install them under
'/usr/local'.

========
UNINSTAL
========
The librcsc can also be easily removed by entering the distribution
directory and running `make uninstall'. This will remove all the
files that where installed, but not any directories that were created
during the installation process.

===========
CONFIGURING
===========
Before you build the librcsc, you must run the `configure' script
located in the root of the distribution directory.

The default configuration will set up to install the librcsc
components under '/usr/local'.

You may need administrator privilages to install the librcsc into the
default location. This locations can be modified by using configure's
`--prefix=DIR' and related options.  See `configure --help' for more
details.
